        <h1>Description of the TACH/GCN database</h1>
        This document provides an overview of the holdings of the TACH/GCN database.
        <h2> The Level 0 table </h2>
        There is a single level 0 table: rawnotices.  This table simply records
        the original content of the GCN notices in the database. Each line in each
        file is stored as a separate record.
        <table border>
            <tr><th colspan='3'>rawnotices</th></tr>
            <tr><th>misson</th><td> A text field with the mission name</td><td>text></td></tr>
            <tr><th>file</th><td> The GCN notice file </td><td>text></td></tr>
            <tr><th>count</th><td> The line count within the file</td><td>integer</td></tr>
            <tr><th>line</th><td>The content of the line </td><td>text</td></tr>        
        </table>
        <h2> The level 1 tables </h2>
        The level 1 tables encode the content of the raw notices in key value pairs
        which support queries.  Each card has been processed and parsed.  The keyword values
        have been extracted and the keyword values scanned and standardized to some degree.
        All dates are converted to MJD.  All durations, to seconds.  Cards where numerical
        information is embedded within complex formats have been parsed and the numerical
        information presented as a number of sequence of numbers.  Where the same information is
        given in multiple formats, only one format has been retained.  The primary table in the 
        level 1 database is the 'details' table which preserves the key/value information.
        <p>
        The details table contains parsed information for each notice line.  The values are available as text and
        as a scalar real value or a real array.  If the real array is populated, the scalar value gives the first element
        of the array.  E.g., If the original card had a value something like
        '1.3 +/- 2.0 [counts]'
        then <br>
        <pre>
          textval is '1.3 2.0'
          realval is  1.3
          arrval  is {1.3, 2.0}
        </pre>

        </p>

            <tr><th>realval</th><td>The value of the notice as a scalar real value.  This is set when the
                    value is parseable as a single or multiple numbers.  If multiple, then this
                    gives the first number in the sequence (i.e., arrval[0])</td><td>real</td></tr>
